# Facial-Recognition-System

## Problem Statement: 
“Facial Detection and Facial Recognition using Intel’s open source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV) and Python dependency”. There are various scripts illustrated throughout the project that will have functionalities like detecting faces in static images, detecting faces in live feed using a webcam, capturing face images and storing them in the dataset, training of classifier for recognition and finally recognition of the trained faces. All the scripts are written in python 3.6.5 and have been provided with documented code. This project lays out most of the useful tools and information for face detect ion and face recognition and can be of importance to people exploring facial recognition with OpenCV. Face Recognition can be of importance in terms of security, organization, marketing, surveillance and robotics etc. Face detection is able to very immensely improve surveillance efforts which can greatly help in tracking down of people with ill criminal record basically referring to criminals and terrorists who might be a vast threat to the security of the nation and the people collectively. 

## Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to comprehensively study and enhance the various means of facial recognition, with a specific focus on improving accuracy and reducing error rates during the recognition process. The project aims to delve into advanced methodologies that contribute to minimizing intra-class variance of facial features while simultaneously maximizing inter-class variance.

## Libraries used:
* OpenCV
* Numpy
* Face Recognition
* Operating System
